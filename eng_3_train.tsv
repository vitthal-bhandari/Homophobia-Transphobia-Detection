Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Dr.Venkatesh Rajagopalan   Sir the mating between animals are in a different manner that is if a animal gave birth to a young one,after attaining the adulteryhood if there is no other animals for mating it mates with the animal which give birth to the young one.; ; According to my sense LGBTI is somewhat equality between the single sex desired person.This justice us just given equality in society.we dont have the rights to criticise them.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Love is an unknown journey, at the end it's to say, I will cross the sea for you, even if I have to walk on the water, I will. Although a short film, it was touching, moving and superbly done, it's an excellent film, with a deep educational and personal message for parents and society. Even today, so many people live unhappily married, just for the sake of cultural beliefs and dictates by society. To the whole cast, producer, story write and director, thank you, well done .. excellent and deep emotional acting by the lead actors, an excellent choice. Much appreciation .. the art to love deeply and if needed, to sacrifice my personal for the love and respect for my parents. It's not about a happy ending it's to see how the story unfolds in the end. Thank you .. hoping for more movies like this!!!

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	It's unfortunately very difficult to be accepted for people on some countries especially for religious countries where people mostly are so religious and just following the dogmas and religion rules.  I feel very sorry for LGBTQ people living in those kind of countries,  their life is not really life but just following other people will.  They cannot be themselves.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Though we all follow indian traditions throughout. Everything is today mixed with 50% western culture which is now unavoidable. It's people's choice to decide whether to follow western culture or not...if we mix western traditions in our culture .

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Please don't compare that stupid with this gorgeous idiot  !!!😠😠														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	First of all stop considering them as a torture as if you feel uncomfortable with their presence better leave that place though your words are right your way of expressing it is something irrelevant as only a few transwomen are getting a golden opportunity to get educated as well to shine well in the career they like but a huge amount of transwomen are still illiterate and uneducated and due to the lack of opportunity and lack of maturity to behave in public area such incidents are happening so kindly do not misunderstand them as they are not doing that purposely

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	i really appreciate you behaviour front of the journalist, bold , you never felt in the trap														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Simple dear. Not only in Tamil Literature , most of the popularly known ancient cultures said the same thing about the women and Most of the Popularly established Religion said the same thing about the women . From the reality there is no literature supports Homosexuality. just think. did you ever hear a story of two Homosexuals ? I m not against her . I m just hate her way of speaking .														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Paavam Rompa Nalla Akka.I Really Proud of you.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	This was very informative. Good job da🤘🏼														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	This film doesn't have a proper ending or any message.  It feels like just bcz LGBT is hot topic, they simply made a film to get likes n views.   In fact, in some perspective this film is wrong.    By breaking up with his partner, he broke tat other guy's heart n dreams.    And by marrying a girl, he will spoil her life too, which is absolutely not acceptable.   If he does not have courage to reveal his truth, tats ok, but at least he must have courage to say NO to marriage.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Thank to Director Mani Shankar Iyer... Awesome script.. Superbbbbb direction. Excellent acting... Real feel.. Touching music... Hopefully they make a sequel too														
Homophobic	It is not mental illness.. But it is genetical disorder... Because harmone masculine process not get done fully 100%... When malini in her mom stomach... Estrogen or testosterone harmone not fully reaches malini brain and mind so malini feels his gender is male... Vice versa to other lgbt.... Ithu ok... Cure will find in future														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Super movie!! The dialogues are clear, relevant and I think quite persuasive. Thanks to try to show the love behind gay relationships and by extension LGBT+ people relationships.; The Tamil society is very conservative. People have troubles to change their mentality because we (LGBT+) are under-represented. The different ways/choice of life should be shown and promoted. In this way, people can think about his own culture and vision of things.; ; A lot of love to the team ❤❤❤														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Good topic upload more videos

Does Ur parents or grandparents were like this absolutely not.. all our elders followed the culture they brought up... Grow up folks.. we are not born and brought up in western.. we still use water only to wash the shit not using paper... We Indians are lead and more civilized society in the world.

Homophobic	Regardless what the science said, I belive  that man were created for women and vice versa, the rest is just the feeling from the satan. We have hundreds of movies telling to accept the fact that the child is gay, can we also have a movie made on the parents feeling and their life after? The struggle, imagine if its their only kid?!. Btw why only portraying only the beautiful part in gay love? Why not showing the consequences? hiv? Std? I like the content on the love of a mother to a son amd how disapointed she were when she got to know..

Well done Nakkeeran for taking a step towards asking the questions.

Saudi Arabia has the least rape percentage among all nations and always commented about its culture is not good especially bad for women . But what the Girls expecting is I need to be like in United States but I need maximum safety like in Saudi Arabia . How could be it is possible??

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Is homosexuality wrong? Definitely not. We are our souls, more than our body. So when our soul can connect with another soul, that connection transcends gender and sexuality. If God created us, then God created our wants, our likes, our dislikes as well. So this is definitely a natural phenomena.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	valtukkal. for your vidio.. homosexuality. meaning modelity sexuality														
Homophobic	If this can be accepted,  then what about people who are incest?! And if someone wants to have relationship with animals?!... That is also feelings right?! ; ; The question is not,  whether its natural or not rather it should be does it affect morality? ..... ; ; We should not see animals as an examples to follow,  its very natural for some animals to eat their newborns.....														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Whether lesbian or gay couple when they are ready to expand their family by adapting an orphan child I appreciate that thought. But some  heterosexual pair give birth to a child and left as an orphan. what will they supposed to be called?

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	I Agree	 LGPT	 Section 377												
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Acting vera level ya.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Encouraging sec 377 is not only a good message but an awesome Message. whether someone is forcing a person to sleep with them, irrespective of whether it's gay or straight is wrong. If someone is trying to convert some one gay, they cannot. Only if the other person is gay he will like it. If not he will reject. If its forced even after rejection from the other side its a criminal offence. Its sexual abuse whether its don't from a man to a women or from a women to a man or frm a man to another man or from a women to another women. It's still crime. However no individual can change his or her sexuality just because someone is trying to.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Rasmin Ras  the hell is wrong with you bro?? It is love between two persons!! Doesn't have anything to do with sex. Let it be same gender or different gender, love is LOVE. If you ignore the gender thing, you will have a broad spectrum about love. Narrow minded persons can't understand these things.🙄🙄														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Time table must want human life														
Homophobic	God created women for men. Not men for men. There is biblical history where God destroyed a town because of homosexuality in that place.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Gayathri Krishnan What do you mean by Jumping away from Gay? I would see her as just another girl. What she does with her life is none of my business neither should it be anybody's. Live and let live. As for the people that jump away, they are clearly not aware or ignorant. As a woman, please try to uplift another woman instead of bringing her down. Namaste.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Well conceived , well emoted  by all actors , crisp direction ,  some long shots with continuous dialogues well done which senior actors were able to do . The character Latif did that  as seasoned actors . Good work Director sir . Another big thanks to the producer who agreed to do this concept . It would take few years for parents to accept these relationships . The next part should be the travel of these partners in relationship facing various situations and how they overcome . Also adoption can be included to make them feel as a family too . Old age and loneliness is a major issue to tackle in these relationships which should be explored further .

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	My advice to Malini would be, do not be negative in your approach.. many people do not have enough knowledge about homosexuality. You need to ensure they understand the science behind it rather than criticizing hetrosexuals.  So when u campain next or give interviews, be positive in your approach..

Homophobic	Even through child abuse many are into homosexuality, especially gays. In that case they definitely need medical help. And now what I've seen is, many young children who are in school or college are confused about their sexuality coz of these so called bold pplz stories who came out of the closet. The kids totally gets confused on picking their sexuality and being misled. So when the homosexual ppl have their own rights to do what they want in their bedrooms, we too have the similar rights to request them to not share their inspirational stories to the ppl around and prompt it.

Homophobic	Hello Bro, I'm glad someone is frankly talking about this topic..  just like you said that each group of people have their own perspective about homosexuality .. Scientists, Religious or Psychologists.. our astrologers also have their perspective.. they have said that Sarpa Dosham could be the reason for homosexuality.. Sarpa Dosham is basically a defect in one's DNA structure.. a structure that is not geometrically correct with how it actually supposed to be. Cosmic laws and the cosmic creation is above everything.. anything that's not aligned with the creation is seen as a defect. ; So my perspective is also the same.. I see homosexuality as defect in one's body.. something that nature would never accept. There are some people who like to have sex with animals and would go to an extent to even marry an animal.. does nature accept their intimacy? No, it's clearly an act of perversion. Similarly, homosexuality is also an act of perversion.. should not be legalized.

A lot of stories, sculptures, erotic scene and got a lot. Don’t simply blame the religion!!!! It’s mentality and society. Don’t blame the nature. In fact every boy baby starts their life as girl baby in womb. It will make sense if your a science student !!!!! Love this movie.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	I'm a medical student and i know for sure that no human is a default carrier of venereal and STDs just because they're homosexual. As far as you're comment is concerned i can see why you choose to beileve in fictious myths of religion over scientific facts. The ignorance is overwhelming in your comment. Just because a person is gay will you maime	 torture them to marry a girl and spoil the girl's life too? Is that the definition of happiness for you. Pity your children if they come out of the closet to you.

Homophobic	hello this is not mental illness or psychological problem but certainly it is the sin you did in your previous birth that you are facing it in this birth called karma vinaigal or reaction !!! Therefore,  do not create any scene now and be humble for the rights the world has given you with its kindness!; ; You claim this as natural as you have no other choice but to defend yourself , but nature do not give you a damn. If you are not able to go through the process of reproduction cycle , you are actually not in favour of the nature's ruling!!!; ; Have you no gratitude for your parents who brought you to this world ?  Well, nature does not make mistake I guess!

If you want to be in this side or that side , I m okay with that.Men always have the advantage of being what we are. I don't care about the women stuffs .You girls want to sleep with lot of guys ???

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	jesus baby  Hi														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Haniezry Mikail  that's the whole point, people like you want us to be ashamed of our sexuality but No, we are not ashamed of our sexual orientation and there is nothing wrong in any Human sexual orientation. What's wrong is people like who make our lives miserable and hard. No one chooses their sexuality. No one chooses to be treated like a second class citizen in their own country. What you need is self education and awareness. My parents are happy for me because I'm happy with my life and if that makes your ass burn then use BURNOL. We are Queer and We are Proud. Your shame card do not work on us anymore cause we have the same rights as you in this country. Keep your illogical  homophobic opinions to yourself.

People don’t understand it but we know how hard for us to live in lie always ..										
Homophobic	priyadharshini kannan   Are you telling narrow minded ok understand.. Broad minded person will know and accept my point.. Love and attraction doesnt have any gender..

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	It will take time to see the changes in the society regarding gay but we have to think from parents side how hard it is to know that their son is a gay also they will thought shame in brought up the child as gay in society unknowingly they can't digest this because of  lack of awarness this kind of movie should be created before itself to create awarness.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	justu missu seriously? Our culture and religion never encourage us to talk ill about others. This is the very basic any most important of all. Now I m confuse.. again which culture u are from?

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	aneesh cool dude Im nt feminist. As a man u dont need any ism to get ur rights. Im asking human rights. When its denied just cauz Im woman then it becomes women rights. I agree naa when I told woman are good. I never told that. That is wt Im saying. Woman can equally bad as man. How can u steal knowlwdge bro?  will u say we stole electricity? Humanity alone is enough to cultivate human values. Culture is fear. They are scared from getting bad names so they follow it. Why am I tagged as feminist? Im just speaking about cultural norms. Change is needed both in culture and law. law is favoring woman and culture is favoring men. Both should be changed. tat is my idea.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	The Commenters who have commented so badly in this video.I just want to throw a question to u ppl.Did u ppl filled a column on ur Facebook profile that I'm Interested in.How many of u filled that column as Men and Women.If u ppl were filled that like this.Then I will say U r also comes under section 377.Section 377 is for LGBT ie.Lesbian,Gay,Bisexual and Transgender right.I think so u ppl we known abt these category right.if ur filled like that in ur FB profile then u also comes in it.Dont behave like more intelligent.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	From my point of view,; i. Joint me congratulate the team for the wonderful presentation. It's a great effort and will enlighten many individuals.; ii. The storyline and the characters carried wonderful messages and awareness. In general, this is common in this situation, however the viewer will get exposure to contemplate the perception on certain topics. Some may recover from past unpleasant experiences, some get an idea about LGBT and start explore, some may get solutions, some may realise on what was  not known, some may now become well equipped to handle and accept possibilities coz we live in community.; iii. Every individual has their rights to choose their perfect partner and prepare for committed future together.; iv. Every couple, regardless gender, age, race, religion, caste, status, colour etc may face challenges. It's the true care and love is matters to stay strong till the end. Understand and accept each other by accepting and embracing entirely including the weakness and flaws. Appreciate and compliment each other and become complete, wholeness felt within. Hence, this is blessings and be grateful.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	girubhakar T  When I say man as Sir,I also say mam when I talk to a elder person.See how women today are.Dont look into history bcoz no one knew what happened exactly.I see  ladies walking alone at 12 night in bangalore.Still when some women talk about women empowerment,thats when I get angry.I think in south,women were and are given respect.Bith men and women plays equal role in maintaining the family.Women take care of home, kids and men supported financially.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Very good interview.. congrats sennila... for a fast time I've seen a casual,  simple , humble and  trans with 0% attitude... very matured interview.......														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	one of the best video..														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	A well contemplated short film with a very subtle yet powerful message about a father's turbulence towards his son's sexual orientation and on being true to yourself. It makes us wish we were Latif, to love someone with purity and be brave or to be Harish having that someone special in life to rescue us from all the turmoil and to clear the road for us. The emotions were lively and it will bring a tear of joy when we see them hold hands in the end. They have scored well in cinematography the way they have captured emotions on screen is amazing. It reflected every gay person's strife they go through in the process of coming out to his/her family. overall Excellent movie!!

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	No words to say														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Sinthu Kuna   u say a movie need not be blunt and say a message.? 	 	 He admitted he is gay bcz the security already knows it.	 	 Removing specs do not signify anything... unless u decide to perceive so.	 	 And perception will differ from person to person. So it can't be stated as a Loud n clear message.								
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Just look at these comments. I think 2 days before director naveen was speaking about women rights. There comments were like awesome or bold speech. Bt Just look at the comments here. All kinds of bad words. Very good guyz. Now women dont have rights to speak about women rights only. Bt men can speak and they will be applauded for it. superb guyz superb. All are commenting on her appearance. Why isnt her dress decent? She is wearing full sleeves shirt. She is nt even exposing her skin. Oh k Indian men want woman to be beautiful like saree and accessories. Bt they cant accept her beauty in mini exposing dresses. What u want guyz decide? U want woman to be decently dressed or traditionally dressed? U abuse decently dressed woman too. hypocrites.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Shivkar bapu ji first plane inventer its true ????														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	U really hero bro														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	OMG a bold subject portrayed in such a simple and beautiful way. I could easily relate to Harish and Latif. Latif finally won the war.  Can I hug you for the last time is where my eyes moistened. A great tribute to all the protagonist's who suffered in different ways to get their same sex love pre legalisation of Section 377. One more interesting point is you can convey a strong message of LGBT issue through a film without steamy kisses and body shoving.  Kudos to the whole unit and especially Latif. Good luck for future endeavours														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	I can't control my tears 💧😢😭😭😭	 Really hats off 😇😇😎													
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Sanjiv a if that was my parents wish I would encourage them. Don’t think those who married are happy with their life. Sex not meant to produce babies it is a language that body speaks to each other. Just like u has choice to talk to anyone same goes to yr body where it can’t pick the right person to communicate to I mean to have sex.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	An excellent piece of cinema and a great attempt at showcasing what's happening in India today. I wish more filmmakers would be brave to talk about such themes. Special kudos to Gautam for a superlative effort. Big things are around the corner :-)

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	I have experience with curious guys and straight guys..they tend to try gay sex for pleasure as new thing..they would took some drugs or be in drunk for take gay sex as casual..you are assuming about ur personal experience.. I've seen many manly look gays or hidden gays or bisexual..														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Many of these words are in English. But the words use to scold woman demoralize them sexually. This comes because of the concept Karpu which men are not related to it.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	If you know about homosexually fully talk about that please let stop this topic...😣😏														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	it merely depends on your self confidence.... it is No use in living a fake life compromising your likes desires for the sake of others....there r many people in this Society who r in relationship , some r even living with the permission of parents....all that matters is what u decide and how determined u r in your relationship....

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Kaviya see u dnt need to understand ....You have ur world where u   have difffrent feelings which cant be understood by LGBT ...The same like u ...Just acccept it like everything is love														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Don't wry Varun. Whatever happens, don't hide your character to anyone. LGBT it's not about sex, its about hormones. Just convince them at right time. Time will change everything. And we are different character only, not a shameful character. Right !!! We don't rape anyone, we don't cheat anyone, we don't do any crime. So, be proud and brave to show ur real. Lots of loves ❣️❣️❣️														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Very moving talk by Sennila, what transgenders go through can never be fully understood by rest of us. While most of us believe that one lands in heaven or hell after our death...transgenders go through hell even while being alive here on earth but it is due to the misconception among most of their fellow beings. Transgenders need our understanding and empathy and as their fellow beings we should extend our moral and physical support for their well being. They are just like any disadvantaged person among our society only if we extend our help and support we can justify the lack of disadvantage the rest of us are blessed with in our lives !

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	raping is illegal because thats harming people ; but there's no harm for anyone because of gay marriages. Just imagine how you would feel when you are forced not to interact with any girl sexually because of cultural reasons, thats how they  would feel too. you wouldn't be talking like this if you were in this situation. You talk all about those cultures but tell me what to do with these people should they not  allowed to be  married ? should they starve until death ? or should they be killed or dumped ?

Homophobic	They are doing making public fully damage...														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Lol, look at all the rational comments coming from the land of periyar. This has brought the worst of Tamil nadu people. This makes me question the whole Dravidian movement.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	There are already more than enough ignorant movies that associates STDs and other vices to the LGBTQ community. STD are also very common in heterosexual couples, how many movies on STD occurance in heterosexual couples have been made in India? Just few hundred years ago, some religion(s) tried and prosecuted scientists for proving that the earth revolves around the sun. Therefore, it’s obvious that they don’t know everything and are constantly wrong.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Bro; Many hollywood actors are confessing because it is a publicity act among the field.; Many are there like Jeremy Renner, the hawkeye in Avengers

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	This movie  should be continued as like this mother were accepting him happy life..that will be too gud ..make it sir														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	vasim asaraf Dont think that I support particular religion. i dont support any religion. All are against women. As u said vedas also do that. yes now u came to the point. why this society want to know who is the father? Is it related to culture or some other thing. I will tell you. Actually its the man who wants know that the child is his son. Why he wants to know? Because he wants his property to go to his child after his death. Then wt should be done for it?  Then woman should be with only one man then only man will know that kids born from her belong to him. So like this only karpu , virginity or chastity label was put on women. And these things dont  apply for men.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Hats off to you mam your are the one well educated  well said and we'll done														
Homophobic	If it is mutual okay. Or else if a male or female is attracted to another male or female, and proposes his or her interest ,but if the latter is not interested what will the former do? In some cases if a boy and a girl are in love and if some other boy loves the boy and if the former rejects the proposal then sometimes it may lead to crime. To this against nature. If the proposals are mutual we can accept. But how do we know it is mutual or compelled.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	The worst thing a person could go through is loneliness and being cornered. I think every person is different and special. They have their own beliefs, unless and until it doesn't harm anyone, i feel its ok! let them be the way they want, it's high time we start accepting all kind of people (i'm not just talking about homosexual). let me remind the society one thing the society is us everyone are part of society, the change should come within you first then the society will change.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Subashini Moorthy hi i like this comments

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	She looks so cute 😍														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	What he is saying is his experience of what he saw from his circle of gays but usually, many gay people don't do everything that he says.  When I was in Korea two boys hold hands with each other while walking but that doesn't mean they are gay. He is talking all about the sex life of gay people. Who said gay people don't do alcohol. Not everything is true for everyone.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	What's wrong in that tag														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Good prank show														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	I think you're confusing sexual harrassment with equal rights. More than 1,200 people have been arrested under section 377, out of which 208 were minors. When people especially youngsters come out to their parents they send them to conversion camps or some samiyar bullshit. Section 377 may have been decriminalized but I personally think that India has a long way to go before it becomes safe and common to be a part of the LGBTQ+ community.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	There are a lot of south Indians too..

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	humans have sense to think right? we are modern animals. LIFE CREATES LIFE people dint know about the consequences about this														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	7: 48 iam crying 😢 😭														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Prateekshaa  I didn't say its based on medical science reports. I said in the hearing of so many years the judges have also considered the medical science report inroder to give this final judgement. Which means we should all respect it and treat them equally. Forts of all we should stop saying, we need to treat them equally because we are literally nobody. We aren't doing a favour by treating them equally. They have all the right to be treated equally. Rather we do not have the right to discriminate. And as far as my previous comments are concerned, when that guy said people gays are converting others as gays, I said nobody can convert anyone gay. And if sex is forced whether its by a gay or a straight guy, it's still an offence. And that's true														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	nice film, nice story,nice actor														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	harrish u do  not know Jesus s love man may cheat god will not cheat by my previous coment what I am going to get . r u goin to give me 1cr														
Homophobic	Momosexual are more affected with std...														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	DRAGON BALL FAN u sure? Coz I've met many gay guys in real life and very bare minimum of them have sex. In fact, I've never met a gay guy with AIDS. It's because of lack of awareness! There are people who doesn't know that HIV spreads through gay sex. Not all gay men are intellectuals same way not all straight ppl are dumbos.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Good clarification madan...														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Acting good bro														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	I found the director instagram id -  Share your comments to them, so they must think of doing Part 2														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	If you don't have a particular problem, when someone else has, the problem, it does not mean it's unnatural and weird..step in their shoes. Heterosexuals have no rights to bully or dominate homosexuals ..Be a human be considerate ..First try to get to learn before putting forward your opinions..They do have feelings..

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	I would love to mention here that there are many gay couples who are living happily....

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	My opinion is having sex is their own personal life and we shouldn't judge are stop it 	 But I don't why it is becoming a mistake and it is very better to control even birth rate also													
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Who cry when she dance for him...	 Yes I'm crying.													
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	A woman is called sister, mother, wife, premika, daughter, grandparent, maami, chithi, periyamma....but they are lesbians call them in that name they should like. If they offend then it is sure that homosexuality is a disease. That's what they say man women and homosexuals they don't want to join the community as girls so y u give them women's lables. Rite..!?														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	It's their own choice, why should we brother if they not disturbing to us.. It's their freedom.. They  should deserve it.. It's such a welcoming judgement

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Hamelton Melvin  thanks for your good response.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	aneesh cool  so u compare Knowledge like Yoga to property. Its common here. They see women also as property. Change of mindset is needed. If a girl is scolding a boy , then she has personal issues with him. Does she scold u because of ur dressing style? Whn there was porn ban going on. Men was like its my choice. Do I have right to say for men stop watching porn, dont drink and dont visit prostitutes. Evn I want to ban smoking in India bt can I say that? 80% of men will come like my choice. So are these men disciplined? Musically is a app for people who want to become famous. Those woman are intentionally saying those words to become popular. They know if a woman speaks like that, they will become famous. U cant even understand this strategy. Sunny leone has become famous it not because she is talented. That shows our society is sexually repressed.

Homophobic	Horrible... People like this should be given immediate treatment. why on the earth you people get a treatment. Instead of boasting yourselves proudly.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	vasim asaraf I think ur name say that u r muslim. And the number 4 also proves it. K yes u can marry 4 women if they are ok with it. I have no problem. Unless its not forced, u can do it. Bt does ur Islam allow women to marry four man? This is the question. If I marry four man, then dont ask me. Leave marrying four men lol if girl is in relationship with more than one guy. Ur language has very beautiful words. Whn religion condemned polygamy for men lol? They have all freedom to marry how many they want. It was IPC that made a law for monogamy. In Tamil Nadu only great grand fathers were getting married to multiple woman.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	vasim asaraf Dont force me to quote verses from Holy Quran k. Do u think I have not read it? Im reading about every religion. And I have not found one that truly cares about welfare of women. Quran clearly states a man gets share that equals to two female. is it not mentioned? Even as a witness in court,  there should be two men. If they get only one man, they should be accompanied two women in the place of other man. Men are twice higher than women tatz wt they are saying. I didnt mention chapter and verse no. If u want I can. Im nt speaking with arrogance. I want you to know Im reading Scriptures. Cauz they think Im speaking like this cauz Im nt aware of it. Actually people who support culture are the ones who are unaware of their own history.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	thanks a lot														
Homophobic	If you note carefully, the IT people are accepting it, means this is what the IT has given us. In my view Indian Govt should feel ashamed of such culture spoiling judgement...

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	vasim asaraf religion dont homosexuality lol they dont support women only. So why women should follow this religion or culture? She cant be priest in temple, Imam in mosque or Father in a church. So who is protecting this culture? Its actually men are who are protecting culture. Every rituals that constitutes ur culture are lead by men be it marriages or any other ceremony. It is started by men, for men and of men. So how can women spoil culture when she is nt even part of it. Im nt against culture. From the day I was born its ur culture which is against me. Every religion plays a drama saying their God is for everyone bt its nt the truth.So I dont get any right in ur culture and all I get is lot of duties lol  Dont say women to follow culture cauz she is not part of it. And Im happy she is not.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	aneesh cool So the freedom women is getting now is because of law. If law was nt made then these things would have been impossible. So credit goes to the law. Do u think this would have been possible cauz of culture. This is where we make mistake by saying women are respected. Bt India is a place of two extremes. Women is respected and disrespected here only. now who are those women getting respect? As I told already, if she follows rules of culture. Culture dont pray feminine energy for its uniqueness.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Saranya   Hello Sharanya,; The students were a lot matured than I thought. I was so happy that they all expressed their views without having hurt anyone. Sometimes we feel that kids should keep quiet or rather not discuss about these things. But we must not forget that they are the future.;  Also we all know how important it is as a skill to express one's views. The skill can only be developed only when they are given the chance to express themselves.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	They are genetically males. But due to lack of androgen receptors  excess androgen converted into oestrogen and will appear outside as females. And they will look taller, clear skin, with bigger breast. But female reproductive organs will be absent. Even the person who has this syndrome not aware of this. They will be usually supermodels. I m not sure there is rumour that hindhi actress radha who is Gemini daughter also has this syn. So next time if u see very beautiful girl pls be careful:)

Homophobic	The film is good... a good try.... Why r u trying to emphasize on security's personal life that his son is gay or not...so now security knows that his son is Straight so he relaxes...in the immediate cut, u r establishing that Arjun feels guilty to be in closet and accepts to lead his life as he is... but u didn't anywhere emphasize  what he is going through right now and why suddenly he plans to come out of closet... this lead me a thought that this film is from security' s pov and he is happy that his son is Straight and Symphatetic on Arjun for being gay...so basically u r establishing that gay men or largely LGBT members are like handicapped....so feel pity on them

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	377 section  correct  ok  congratulations good  job														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Saranya  u r not getting one thing. As long as reservation system is there in the society, no one forgets their caste. Everywhere ppl would be asking for caste from hospitals, education ,govt jobs everything is related to caste bcos they need this caste for reservation purpose. Imagine if there is reservation concept, why do any one need to mention their caste? Probably after 2 generations, no one even remembers what caste they belong to as they would never ever used the caste for any purpose.

Even u might be using soap. Bt I use herbals mostly in my lifestyle. Dont think that I support western lifestyle. Im just against outdated norms. Bring culture in ur lifestyle. Have traditional living bt dont suppress modern thinking. Whole world knows Yoga is from India. Even if they use it, let them use it.  Then world will become more peaceful. Yes it has become business I agree. We should regulate it.

You are not doing any favor by accepting her or him. You are just fulfilling your responsibility. By accepting others the way they are you are also helping in creating a better society that values, diversity and accepts the uniqueness of people as they are.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	In India LGBT was practiced and had rules favouring them  too.  British being a homophobic country during that era when conquered India ,they abolished that  system and made LGBT illegal and those who considered themselves gay ,bi or lesbian were mentally abused and physically tortured by the British and indian psychiatrists or other medical practitioner. This happened even in the own country.  In the end those LGBT people were called mentally ill and they commited suicide. ; ; I personally liked this video eventhough I'm straight. But after watching Ben Shapiro and Jordan speeches and reading their books , people's views about concept of homosexuality will definitely change ( only if positively taken). I have great respect for homosexual people and their feelings.; ; And finally I believe that homosexual people in India do not act like those Western people. What they are demanding was absolute trash. ; Good day

Be not deceived neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Homosexuality is not sin. It is a natural process. It will be growing exponentially, it is nature’s way of controlling birth. It is sad that indian government is following western rules. ; In Indian mythology vali, sucreevan mother probably homosexual. She was described as ‘ man in daytime and women in the night ‘. Making the homosexual as criminal it self is a crime.

Homophobic	I support lgbt I love gay and lesbian people														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	It's crt only it's their own choice														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	I pondered on that as well. But it's necessary to slowly get rid of this taboo surrounding transgenders. At the very beginning of the video the interviewer mentions all the absurdity in showing transgender interviews so far on TV.														
Homophobic	This is 100% true on suburban trains which happens on daily basis, they harass public for money. Railway police need to be vigilant & take strict action against these unlawful people. They do both physical & verbal harassment, which is against de law. They should be put behind bars.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Beautiful story. I am more like Latif. Who gets extreamly defensive at times. Love the way it was narrated.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	A bear was chasing a rabbit and the rabbit was very successful at evading the pursuit, God appeared before them granted them 3 wishes each. The bear went first and wished for him to be most handsom bear in world. The rabbit wished for a mortor bike. The bear was confused, and wished for the second time that he must be the only male bear in the world. The rabbit wished for an helmet the second time. The bear was very puzzeled this time and started to mock the rabbit how stupid he is for wasting all wishes for trivial  things he doesnt need. Then the bear wished for the final time that all femal bear in world to be in his proximity. The rabbit finally wished I wish this bear to become Gay and hopped onto the bike wearing the helmet and scooted away.; ; btw this video is gay!!														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Royal Queen  U r exactly rit d ma.....even am having dis same doubt....

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	But indian society and the majority of the ppls are still the same														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Yes.. love is love. Anyone can fall in love with anyone.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	We humans have overpopulated the world anyways so why the drama?Just let people live the life that they want!														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	It is easier for girls to talk openly about this topic than guys. You will never get a true answer if you do public opinion in this topic.  Most Muslims, and Christians, Sangi type Hindus, less educated/exposed people, and egoist males won't accept. All they care about is progeny and population.It takes a lot of emotional intelligence(EQ) to  understand and care about human emotions, living a false life, false marriages, divorces, psychological issues, suicides and depression .

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Superb. Was wondering why such a lengthy one, but due to the explanation of feelings in detail really made it possible to feel good and happy when they held each other's hands.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Don't worry! I support all my LGBT citizens and proud to call myself as an ally! And also they took the interview in local beach not inside any university campus 🤣 so don't expect those intelligence from these potential rapists who can't think beyond sex 🤦	 P.S. My gay friend looks more manly than any of these beings interviewed here but the irony they are making fun of masculinity of Gay men 😂 🤣

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Fine if they are born such a way and not comfortable with formation of the culture out of copycat influences but acceptable if majority of society accepts the culture. I'm not against or support but accept it if the society accepts it just like how we accept many things in life including ruling government despite some voted while others not. We tolerate and live in harmony on basis of humanity. There are many do and don't according to the law of the nation and land and we follow it based on democratic concept and as a rational people shall tolerate things that even seems awkward to us. Do not discriminate the genuine victim, like they said, it's their life and they decide on what they want out of this life. Please make constructive comments and do not insult anyone. Respect is the basis of humanity.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Hi..just felt like sharing this here.. I organized a debate in my class 3 days back. The students were from class 7,8 and 9. The topic that I gave them was Homosexual couples should be allowed to raise kids. ; I was so surprised that all the students spoke for yes except for two boys. The students in the yes team spoke so well saying that all kids deserve love, all kids deserve a home, the kids of such parents grow up to be more open minded, stronger,  respect others feelings, the kids don't end up being a threat to the society etc etc.....; I was very happy to see the younger generation speak so positively with an open mind about things that is still seen as a taboo by most of us in the present generation.

Basically abusing is wrong.There r words they use to scold dads too..Do you see only the bad words they use??..Even girls are saying the word oth*** nowadays.Now,You see women are empowered enough to scold a boy with the same words boys uses to scold another  boy.Have you ever tried opening musically app??..I can say boys today are more disciplined than girls.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Bible says a lot more. But I don't think anyone amongst us lives word by word relating to bible. And before quoting these verses that prick and blame others, remember to remind yourself the most important verse from bible,  love your neighbour as you love yourself.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Superb movie. Very realistic and emotional.  Fantastic acting by both.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Hi Director Lokesh , awesome movie and well said about the feelings of LGBTQ community people. Love is not only sex and nudity. It's beyond everything. I loved to watch the movie. I hope so u remember me I'm the character Chandrama's real Daughter Ash.. I still remember when my mom said she will not act in this movie because she didn't know what exactly the story was. I explained her about it and then she accepted to be a part of this awesome movie. Thankyou so much for going against all odds in this society and creating positive and expressing the feelings of LGBTQ.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	It’s between 2 individuals why don’t ppl respect their privacy and move on. About time India looks forward,  rather going backward... when rest of the world has accepted same Sex legality and Marriage. India has taken many decades to improvise section 377 when are They gonna legalise G&L wedding ... I would say India has still long way to go. No point blowing their own vessel in so called arrange marriage not knowing what their kids actually want...  relationship is all about happiness and harmony... let’s respect the decision of Supreme Court and move on with lives.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	After all, they are fellow human beings!														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	aneesh cool so u need change in law right. Correct. Even I told that law is favoring women and culture is favoring men. Both should be changed. U want change in law bt cant accept change in culture. Now a change came. Article 377. This change is boon for homosexual men. And how many men are supporting it? We dont need special women empowerment. Leave the nonsensical social norms, a woman will get empowered by herself.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	aneesh cool yes it was made by men. What do u expect? A woman should come for it lol Patriarchy killed very possibility of women. It was so cruel evn that good men couldn't tolerate. That is why they helped women. Bt how many are there? That is why Im against patriarchy . Definitely not men. There are woman who are product of patriarchy who put another woman down. Bt there are men who support woman. Patriarchy is a thought tatz it it has nothing do with gender.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Saranya  what do u think about my perception? people tries to find a life in butt hole :)														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Saranya the thing is the message is there. He tells off the security guard to show he has accepted who he is. A movie doesn't need to be blunt and say the meaning. But I guess everyone perceives it differently. I believe the message is loud and clear

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Brilliantly tapped on the sensitive facts n the way to go!!Amazing film.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	This is a  big problem for lgbt. How can you neglect it. This is their personal choice. What is the great issue more than this?  When you people have a life like this, at that time only you will feel this as a great issue.. Do not be so selfish.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Congrats that guy														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	That is culture profiling to think that only Americans express their sexuality openly with the same Gender. Even if other countries ban public affection that looks Gay, they cannot get rid of people who are attracted to the same sex. The more Society tries to cover, the more desperate people become. And sometimes desperation leads to Victims and heart break. Instead of fairness to Humanity. And the freedom to express love in a manner fit for all sexual orientations.														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Please don't play with other emotions.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Pon namer sent me people														
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	raja s  I'm sorry to hear how your world view is narrow and pigeonholed into religious views. I can just say I am not going to force any of my views on you. I shouldn't. You have the right to live however you want, but that right stops when it intrudes into another person wellbeing. Just like you don't want anyone to force anything on you, you shouldn't force it on anyone else. That's the basic point. Looking at your reply I can see that you are trying to force; 1. Religion on non believers; 2. Caste by default with your allegiance to Vedas. ( You are glorifying vedas without actually reading it. Vedas confer வர்ணாஸ்ரம, the disgusting way of organising people based on birth); 3. Your narrow view of exclusively dual sexuality only. Please read about ' genders and sexuality'.

Fight for equal right is a must and everyone should respect the other person's space.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	A sophisticated yet forthright film that shines the spotlight on homosexuals in India and their struggle for basic human rights. It is uplifting and hopeful to watch the young protagonist Latif confidently and respectfully challenge cultural norms and attitudes in India. A powerful film that should nudge us towards a better understanding of sexual diversity in nature and acknowledgement of the sexual spectrum in humans. A film that empowers young adults to advocate for themselves – congratulations on winning the Best Themed Feature Length Movie Award at the  Chennai Rainbow Film Festival – 2015! Kudos to the young actors, musician K. Gautam and writer/director Mani Shankar Iyer for their groundbreaking work!

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Wonderful Short video....keep it up.  Before gay....comes a very big 'gray' ! Most people live in this gray area and it is kept hidden. In reality there is no regular or normal.  90% so called straight people have some same-sex experiences or in a repressed society, at least have same sex desires or thoughts. Ask yourself honestly and the answer will be yes.       So who is anybody to decide that people cannot think straight..........everybody should first mind their own business and see that they are not abusive in their own relationships in life.  GAY or Straight, manushalla vazha vidunga!

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	If you are born Gay or Bi'..This is not your fault neither your parents fault but this is how God made us n you are born in this way. If you love with a person with the same sex it doesn't mean that you're abnormal or you've a mental problem. Gay, bi or straight all are born normal because God made us all n God doesn't make a mistake. We are born perfect..n we are all born for a purpose..we are all born to be love n we are born to share our love to someone that our heart wants to be with..so no matter who you are maybe GAY, BI' or STRAIGHT.. love the person that your hearts decide but not other people choices.; ; Sorry, my english is not good but I hope all of you will understand my point.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Mohamed Ali  497? It's not okay fr me. But as far as I've read adultery can b used as a reason fr divorce so if my partner cheats me I would rather move out (divorce), rather than blackmailing them with the law. As far as I've understood about relationship, a law isn't needed to hold a promise of monogamy.
