# Homophobia-Transphobia-Detection
Code for the shared task on homophobia/transphobia detection at the second LT-EDI Workshop @ACL 2022

Here is the codalab webpage: [https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/36394](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/36394)

We have experimented with a variety of mono-lingual and multi-lingual transformer models along with data augmentation techniques for detection of homophobic/transphobic content among topical youtube comments in 3 settings: English, Tamil and code-mixed Tanglish language.

More details will be released soon alongwith the system description paper.
