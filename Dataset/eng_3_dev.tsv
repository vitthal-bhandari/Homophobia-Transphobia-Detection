Homophobic	The western countries choosed india to spread and legalized this section 377.. they achived their target. Next they will try with saround countries To implement this law as soon.This type law is completely against with nature.. We know the way of enviromental polution. Cutting trees, putting carbage in to rivers, burning garbage etc.. These are the things affacting the nature directly. When we act against nature,the nature will start to fight with us. The law related to LGBT is also like we are calling the nature for challange.. Sex with man and weman is nature. But sex with boy and boy or a girl with girl is completely against with nature. If we do and accept definately we will face facts like # HIV AND AIDS DESEASE# DECREASE IN POPULATION# MUTUAL DIVOURSE CASES# PROSTITUTIONS# NATURAL DISASTERS (SPECIFICALLY EARTH QUAKE ) study the history of german before and after implemented this law# CULTURAL IMPACTSand many..; It will not take longer time to get the bad feedback from this law..They are try to demolish the india this is obsolutely clear

(Or having sex with him) and I know the difference between love and friendship, if that's wat u were implying on the naming of relationships in India (y India? Coz other countries have no names fr various relationships?) I am neither going forward or backward I'm minding my own business u should try it too!! Feels good u know?

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	I will get blessings from that Good soul.								
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Yes. The correct answer would be, homosexual behaviour is commonly observed in nature amongst animals such as lions and elephants. In fact, unlike the pairing between a male and female which is only for a short moment, these male to male relationship actually lasts for years and sometimes for a lifetime.								
Homophobic	Samuel 12:11 New International Version (NIV); ; 11 “This is what the Lord says: ‘Out of your own household I am going to bring calamity on you. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you, and he will sleep with your wives in broad daylight.; ; Iduku homosexual thevalam!.. 😂🤣🤣

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Nishanth Akash  clearly you haven't, this law was imposed by the colonial government 150+ years ago and it was repealed and again appealed in the 2000's. For the record it not based on medical sciences it's based on pure bigotry and bullshit. I'm not giving you half baked facts I'm giving you full perfectly correct and true facts that you're way too fragile to take in because you don't want them to be treated the same way you are, which by the way is pure disgusting. And for he record, its miss. So get yourself educated CORRECTLY.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	They can adopt children. Many parentless childrens are there. 377 section is broken for good cause i would say. When people are born with gay / lesbian thoughts then we cant change them its their mentality and their love.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Love is Love. And Everyone should be able to Marry their loved one irrespective of their gender, under consent, without any regret. Genuine loving people are affected by poor close-minded people's laws. ; 1st - India already had Homosexuality in their Culture! ; 2nd - British came, ruled us and made the section 377 to ban Gay sex (which obviously means - some Indians were gay at that time) ; 3rd - British went back and Normalized Gay love and legalized Gay Marriage. Here we are still holding on to their colonial era law and stigma around that they left behind, as like English language. Time is High to revive a Basic Human Right to Love, and our Indian culture which also includes in itself, LGBT community. ; ; P.S: You don't have to be Gay/lesbian to voice out for LGBTQ rights! just the way, You don't have to be a Woman to support/voice out for Women's rights								
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	I ask one question this world was created to live 2 gender only we give respect to 3 gender

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	vasim asaraf wow how convenient? people are like that. k then leave it. yes every religion does that it includes Christianity too.see Im nt here to say which is right or wrong. Your religions have already done that. Here issue is when man does its not wrong. When women does it a sin. That discrimination is the problem. See Im just speaking about injustice. Bt u r speaking about sleeping with guyz. Man can easily get married to many women and stay with them in one house.  Thanks to law, if nt even today this will be the situation. I dont need culture to loyal to my husband. Women in ur culture will be having secret affairs. Bt I have the dareness to openly walk out of marriage if I dont like it . Many woman are scared to do that. Again its the culture. Its killing the couple who want to be together in the name honor killing. On the other hand its forcing a couple to stay in marriage even if they dont like it. keep it up

Kudos to Mani and the entire crew for not just portraying the love and the sentiments of the parents so beautifully, but also showing courage to prove that 'it's just a question of love' and not about 5 ml of liquid. I hope that our so called society wakes up to the reality that we are denying a life with dignity to so many people around us, just because they are different.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Very relatable story.	 	 I'd also like to point out a few more arguments against forcing gay male children to marry a girl against their wishes and nature. Parents should think that the girl's like is also being ruined. Most Indian families take it for granted that the girl can be subject to this kind of cheating and humiliation.	 	 Thanks Mani Shankar for this film.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Many Ancient Religions never had opposed diversity in human beings. They were all inclusive of such diversified people in the social group. Only the modern fanatics of the religion say it is a sin. ; The 'religion' from the land of India never considered it a detestable practice or sin. It had gods born of two male gods(ayyapan),gods with androgynous forms(arthanareeswara) and many more. Only with the British colonial rule such diversity was curtailed and made a punishable crime.								
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	KUDOS..🤝🙏👏❤Really a pure good idea of pranking a transgender rather than wasting time of pranking others. 	 Hatsoff 👏to the team fr this huge step..... & fr expressing good in them	 	 This may b a inspiration for other prank channels	 	 Keep stepping forward

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Malini ask questions why u can give answer because is true every body gives comments is very bad but u think after u get answers I support								
Homophobic	Sissy, u have great attitude, confidence but that doesn't mean that all ur points are correct. God created Adam and eve and not Adam and steve. For every matter there is only one judgement either it may be true or false..there is nothing in between if ur idea is deep correct to 100% I always admire that being a lady u come to media and talk about ur idea on homosexuality... it needs great courage.. but I m sorry ur ideas are impure. Now a days ppl come out and talk about homosexuality as their choice...and u deal it as correct. .after decades few ppl will come out talk about having sex with animal and dead bodies as correct and tell them as their choices..one or two ppl with this idea will be having a nice attitude and confidence. ....but that means their choice is correct?? My final conclusion is ur attitude may be right but not ur ideas. Change your habits and thoughts and I'm sure u will regret if u r not going to change								
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Every one tease them because they are a trans gender then to those people I say and what would u say about Shivan and Parvathi .they are also god.so please do not tease them .help them

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	19:40 - 19:41 correct . 157 years britishers put  this rule . Only 1 or2 points I don’t accept . Like sati system - in Mahabharata madri voluntarily did , not kunti. Even before in Ramayana none of the 3 queens of dasaratha did sati . People started to follow sati system and child marriages  more vigorously after Muslims ,  Portuguese , britishers etc invaded India . ; I appreciate LGBT . Arjuna was eunuch for 1 year, Shikandi a transgender , shambha, Lord Krishna’s grandson was interested in wearing girl clothes .... so to my knowledge some were kept open and some were hidden in history . But open history suggests that we appreciated and accepted . ; I  condemn  rapists of any sexuality and religion . I condemn politicians .  Just like heterosexuals come into private life of LGBT,  so does these politicians who come into religion , caste etc and divide people for their own political career .

Homophobic	Bro it was really sin definitely they will punished								
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Its just my view about this topic.; I agree all the things u told about science, psychology, religion and taught process of homosexual ppl.; All these things start at the same point as of my knowledge, bcoz a person's gene hav all the activities of their ancestors which includes everything like knowledge, arts,disease, physical appearance etc.., If we travel back to some 1000s of yrs back i wont be an issue with gene instead as psychology say it might be a practice of ppl living b4 which got into the gene and now its termed as the genetical change. I will not share my opinion as right or wrong abt this but i feel like this is not natural in early days which is natural. Thr was a genetical change happened due to the practice of thr ppl living long b4. ; That's all abt it								
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	I don't know  y these things are interviewed such a shameful creature and she is speaking in tamil such an insult to tamil it's a major sin according to Quran don't upload these things and destroy this culture								
Homophobic	sattam olungum kudumba amaipum need not and does not dictate who we should fall in love with. stealing and killing is wrong because it harms other people..first of all understand what is right and wrong and why it is right or wrong..... what you are doing is wrong...compelling someone to be the way you want just because it suits your norms is what is wrong.

Homophobic	Think about one generation where no male wants to live with female and no female wants to live with male. It will be the end of the humans. Male to male should not be attracted for sexual desires. they can be friends. people think this as freedom but this is not. Don't consider transgender as lesbians or gays. They change their sex and then they are attracted to opposite sex. Don't think that whatever foreign countries do as correct. We were the people who were leading culturally. they should follow us not the reverse.

They replied it's nasty.;    Mate , lemme say ya something... Every nation got their traditional life and culture. We aren't supposed to go out from it.;     In India , especially north side showing belly and navel is normal and modesty but in UK it's vulgarity. ;    But in the UK showing cleavages is normal thing but here in India. It's vulgar thing.;    God created us with pairs. Read Vedas and try to live what it says.;      We can't go against God .
