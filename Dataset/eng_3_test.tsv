Non-anti-LGBT+ content	excellent movie..no unnecessary drama or scenes.. was very natural..back ground music is really superb..thank u everyone involved fr giving a wonderful movie to watch..best thing was the lead actors were depicted MALE-ISH.. quite contrary to most directors who like to show gay love happens between some one who has FEMININE body and thoughts..well done sir. Looking forward fr more movies frm U.                        
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	For those who speak about culture., pre marital sex, illegal affairs after marriage, rape and a long lost will continue which is not Indian culture . Being gay/ lesbian/ transgender Is hormone imbalance, even before they are born. It’s not they choose to become. Even your son or daughter can be.. Like if you agree, and I don’t care for dislikes or hate replies.

Homophobic	Sathya Narayanan , it was encouraged in western world even today..  It's seen as an alternative to marriage.. For example,  Few women groups say/encourage  this way of life to escape from men, they claim men are aggressive n dominant..  Escape from them n stay with your own gender.. I meant those kind of things... Of course it's a threat to humanity..  It's one of the main reason why white ppl are becoming minorities in the own land..

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	There are really some people who's brain needs to be grown..  Let the person be homosexual or hetro or bisexual or transgender - treat everyone as humans..  What's wrong in it..  How male and female have feelings and attraction towards each other... Same male male or female female also have.. It's genetics what you or me can do.  It's natural..there are even people like bisexual.  They get attraction towards male and even females both.. It's not wrong.. Culture culture what culture you guys expecting.. If we say male to not have sex with female..?  Is it okay.. Same like that gay or lesbians..  Understand that they are born like that.. It's natural..  Treat everyone as humans.. And don't be abusive.. You have no rights to decriminate others feelings..

Homophobic	You father is getting by homosexual then how to you born in the world. Your speech was not justice for human being very talented. So your homosexual thinking created and developed by yourself and by your living situation. That's your problem so don't criticize to anybody for this issues. Peoples be allotted and keep to distance of this type of guys I advise to all the peoples especially for young generations. This is our culturally very bad and worst activities and God's is not creating this type of homosexual man's and lespian woman's.

Is it because the lesbian girls stole all the chances u had with the bi girls? If not, how about minding ur own business? U can b more productive if u stop all this hate!

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	havish srinivasula we think tat if schools n other institutions do not ask our caste then we will forget it.    Tats a myth. Do u think caste is such a small thing tat ppl will forget. NO. It may happen in some cities. But India majority is village. Ppl always remember their caste, take pride in tat and discriminate others. Reservation system is their to give some relief to the discriminated ppl.   ; ; So root cause of reservation system is discrimination.; ; Reservation is just a remedy to give relief.; ; We cannot remove remedy first. tat will be unfair.; ; We should remove the root cause first. Then eventually remedy will not be required. And we can achieve reservation system free society.

And many are under corrective rape, and some are being killed and physically abused and many are still thinking thst being lgbtq is a disease or illness. Even my parents say it to me daily even though they know thsg I'm gay. I wish they will change.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Vasim asaraf k u think this culture understands femininity. This culture is the first one that teaches wrong femininity. Letz not go to Islam. tatz a shock. letz take Tamil literature only as example. Four qualities of a woman. Accham, madam, naanam , payirpu. Just tell me in this four qualities, which is useful for woman or mother? According to me femininity is mother tatz it. Im asking what ur culture has thought to that mother? u guyz speak  very high abt mother bt u speak bad about woman. U say she is weak. How can a weak woman become a mother? Todays mother are future generation. Have we thought this to our women? Leave feminism did culture understand women?

Shallow minded people like u can’t grasp it. See it as a emotional need instead of physical.

Homophobic	Video was informative and interesting, still things have to be proved how this phenomenon is happening, which is quite precise that the existence of homosexuality is natural or not.if we start saying it is individual rights to live their lives on their own terms then why do we have law and order, jail , police, because even a dacoity or rapist has his own terms and reason  to commit a crime....

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Then you don't have options . And those women are not slaves . No one forces them to live like that. They love it , they feel secure and they find their own path most probably a right one. Go and ask your father that he ever buy a property in the name of your mother. We gave equal property rights to the women. We gave education . Do you know there are more than 70% of women are employed and equally paid . Yes they are covering their body for their safety. You forefathers looted your grannies treasures in the name of Dowry. In Suadi Arabia Dowry and Interest are prohibited . So don't call them slaves again.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	I'm sure people don't like the title of this video. It's obvious this channel did it for clickbait but it can be used in a positive way as well. For people that are transgender or going to become transgender this video can be a motivation that transgenders are able to rise from all challenges and be happy and successful.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Latif character is awesome. Script and dialogue is remarkable.                        
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Sanjiv a I m extremely..Just because she can’t have “straight “ relationship that doesn’t mean she can’t have any other option. Besides that it is her wish and why are u forcing her to be something that she not into. Don’t u think u violating her privacy?

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	For a moment I laughed on people who really don't know what is happening in the reality. Simply giving comments without humanity. Love is love always. Love has no gender. I think people should be mature enough.                        
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Lathif character is amazing.....                        
Non-anti-LGBT+ content	It's a person's own choice. The thing that Indians care about is the baby. Why don't you guys look at adoption as a choice and most importantly it's their choice of having baby.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	This is not a mental disorder issues , actually this is related to changes of hormones... it’s could happen in anyone anytime & any ages...  like boys, should avoid many type of foods which got more contents of female hormones (Estrogen)example as below:; Seeds: flaxseeds and sesame seeds.; Fruit: apricots, oranges, strawberries, peaches, many dried fruits.; Vegetables: yams, carrots, alfalfa sprouts, kale, celery.; Soy products: tofu, miso soup, soy yogurt.; Dark rye bread.; Legumes: lentils, peas, pinto beans.; Olives and olive oil.; Chickpeas.....   men should avoid most of soy products and women should reduce consuming above food after 40’s ... ; For men should take more drumsticks & leaf (moringai/Oleifera) is the best than also oyster, selfish, egg york,  almonds, are will increase the male hormones accordingly.. so it’s nothing to do with attitudes or mental  .... all about hormones truly... Basically more gays than lesbians in the world  due to (XY ) the chances  to adopt famines character are very high... so pls maintain your diet accordingly.. you are what you eat(return in Bagavad Gita) all the best ; to all & no offense to anyone .

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Beautiful movie 😍✨❤ very close to real life incidents.  No nudity, no sex,  neatly shown. All the characters have done great job!! Especially mother's role, was heart touching. I loved it. An excellent message conveyed through this movie.There is an equal responsibility of both coming out guys and parents to   understand and accept the facts. Kids should convince parents in any way as parents deserve to know the real us. Also parents should understand and love the kids for however and whatever they are.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	This is a very good movie and a tool for parents. My parents did not question me when I said I was gay. They only knew that I didn't want to die anymore. That was all they needed.                        
Homophobic	In future a group of people will come & claim that they wants to marry a Animal, own Father, Mother, Sister & Brother, if someone says it's unnatural then they will say you are not too modern or your thoughts are not mature to understand the pure love; they are also have freedom to choose with whom they want to love. We should respect their feelings they are also humans, at the end love is love, if our feelings attracted to Animals or own parents & siblings what we can do. am i correct guys (LGBTQ COMMUNITY)!!?;  🌈🐵🐻🦁🐯🐱🐶🐺🐴🐮🦛🦌🐷👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩💑👩‍❤️‍👩; ; Hit the like button below those who are against this kind of act or community & share your thoughts. 👇👍

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Common people cannot understand the DNA abberations. Gay/Lesbians does not become gay/lesbian by choice or desire. They are born with that. We hide this and get the son/daughter married by force and destroy the life of the girl/boy. I have seen several cases around me.

And I've read many world. medical reports on these. So I guess u need to be more educated. Check ur sources and read properly to get more knowledge.

Non-anti-LGBT+ content	Sheik Dawood Where's the concept of a wife in a gay relationship?. And, it's totally suitable for all environments. Coz, it's human and natural. And, it's not a culture. It's a sexual orientation. No one becomes a gay, and no one can be forced to become gay. It's all inborn.
